What looks like a sketch is actually a data story from rural India.

From it's inception in 2005, ASER surveys measured actual learning levels of children in rural India.

One of the core questions:
Can children in Std III, V, and VIII read a Std II-level text or a story? 

Here's what I found using Tableau ViZ:
ðŸŸ  In 2018: Just 1 in 5 Std III children in government schools could read Std II text.
ðŸ”µ In 2022 (post-COVID): It dipped to 1 in 6.
ðŸŸ¢ In 2024: There's recovery. But still, 3 out of 4 children in Class III are not reading at expected levels.

Even in Std V, only 1 in 2 children could manage to read a Std II text. And shockingly, 3 in 10 Std VIII children still haven't caught up.

Foundational catch-up isn't just delayed - it's disappearing as children move through grades.

We're now five years into NEP, and racing toward the 2026â€“27 target of universal FLN(Foundational Literacy and Numeracy) through NIPUN Bharat. 

But the reality?
Std V and Std VIII kids are still grappling with Std II reading.
The learning crisis is silent. It's ignored. But, it's very real.

So we must ask:
Do children even feel seen? 
Does learning feel like growth or just pressure?

If Std V & VIII kids are still chasing Std II fluency, maybe it's not them who are behind. Maybe it's the system that hasn't caught up.

It's time we imagined different questions, not just different benchmarks.
Maybe alternate pathways to learning aren't "alternatives" at all.
Maybe they're overdue.
